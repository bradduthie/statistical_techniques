# Introduction to probability models

Some background

## A practical example

How to think about probability


## Probability distributions

Some more useful examples

### Binomial distribution

Explanation, fairly straightforward

### Poisson distribution

Another example

### Normal distribution

Why this is so important


# The Central Limit Theorem (CLT)

General overview

## Examples of the CLT in action

## The standard normal distribution

## What are z-scores?


# _Practical_. Probability and simulation

This practical focuses on applying the concepts from chapter 14 and 15 in Jamovi.
There will be 3 exercises.

1. Calculating probabilities from a dataset.
2. Calculating probabilities from a normal distribution.
3. Demonstrating the central limit theorem (CLT).

To complete exercises 2 and 3, we will need to download and install two new Jamovi modules.
Jamovi Modules are add-ons that make it possible to run specialised statistical tools inside Jamovi.
These tools are written by a community of statisticians, scientists, and educators and listed in the [Jamovi library](https://www.jamovi.org/library.html).
Like Jamovi, these tools are open source and free to use.

The dataset for this practical is something a bit different.
It comes from the [Beacon Project](https://www.thebeaconproject.net/), which is an interdisciplinary scientific research programme led by [Dr Isabel Jones](https://www.stir.ac.uk/people/256518) at the University of Stirling.
This project focuses on large hydropower dams as a way to understand the trade-offs between different United Nations [Sustainable Development Goals](https://sdgs.un.org/goals).
It addresses challenging questions about environmental justice, biodiversity, and sustainable development.  
The project works with people affected, and sometimes displaced, by dam construction in Brazil, Kazakhstan, India, USA, and the UK.
Part of this project involves the use of mobile games to investigate how people make decisions about sustainable development.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.alt = "Decorative image shown of the interface of the mobile app game Power Up!", fig.cap = "Welcome screen of the mobile game Power Up!", out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/power_up.png")
```

The game "Power Up!" is available as an [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hyperluminal.stirlinguniversity.sustainabledevelopmentgame) and [iPhone](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/power-up/id1585634888) app.
Data are collected from players' decisions and used to investigate social-ecological questions.
We will use the [power_up]() dataset in exercises 1 and 2.
Note that these data are already in a tidy format, so we do not need to do any reorganising.
